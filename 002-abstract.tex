The goal of this thesis was the exploration of feasible solutions for current security-issues concerning the Domain Name System (DNS). As internet security is tightly connected with DNS security, this is an important topic to investigate. A thorough research of current literature was conducted to determine relevant threats and possible mitigation strategies. Based on this analysis, a proof-of-concept was developed. The evaluation showed that the proposed setup is able to protect DNS Clients from all threats disscused in this thesis. Performance tests reported an increase in the average round-trip-time by only 5-9\%. These results indicate that implementing the proposed approach substantially improves security without significantly decreasing the overall user-experience.
