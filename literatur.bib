abstract = {Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive public-key cryptosystem for mobile/wireless environments. Compared to traditional cryptosystems like RSA, ECC offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes, which results in faster computations, lower power consumption, as well as memory and bandwidth savings. This is especially useful for mobile devices which are typically limited in terms of their CPU, power and network connectivity. However, the true impact of any public-key cryptosystem can only be evaluated in the context of a security protocol. This paper presents a first estimate of the performance improvements that can be expected in SSL (Secure Socket Layer), the dominant security protocol on the Web today, by adding ECC support.},

abstract = {Poly1305-AES is a state-of-the-art message-authentication code suitable for a wide variety of applications. Poly1305-AES computes a 16-byte authenticator of a variable-length message, using a 16-byte AES key, a 16-byte additional key, and a 16-byte nonce. The security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the security of AES; the security gap is at most 14D⌈L/16⌉/2106 if messages have at most L bytes, the attacker sees at most 2 4 authenticated messages, and the attacker attempts D forgeries. Poly1305-AES can be computed at extremely high speed: for example, fewer than 3.1{\&}lscr;+780 Athlon cycles for an {\&}lscr;-byte message. This speed is achieved without precomputation; consequently, 1000 keys can be handled simultaneously without cache misses. Special-purpose hardware can compute Poly1305-AES at even higher speed. Poly1305-AES is parallelizable, incremental, and not subject to any intellectual-property claims},

abstract = {The popularity of “Trust-on-first-use” (Tofu) authentica- tion, used by SSH and HTTPS with self-signed certificates, demonstrates significant demand for host authentication that is low-cost and simple to deploy. While Tofu-based applications are a clear improvement over completely inse- cure protocols, they can leave users vulnerable to even simple network attacks. Our system, PERSPECTIVES, thwarts many of these attacks by using a collection of “no- tary” hosts that observes a server's public key via multiple network vantage points (detecting localized attacks) and keeps a record of the server's key over time (recognizing short-lived attacks). Clients can download these records on-demand and compare them against an unauthenticated key, detecting many common attacks. PERSPECTIVES ex- plores a promising part of the host authentication design space: Trust-on-first-use applications gain significant at- tack robustness without sacrificing their ease-of-use. We also analyze the security provided by PERSPECTIVES and describe our experience building and deploying a publicly available implementation.},

@inproceedings{Stevens2017,
abstract = {SHA-1 is a widely used 1995 NIST cryptographic hash function standard that was officially deprecated by NIST in 2011 due to fundamental security weaknesses demonstrated in various analyses and theoretical attacks. Despite its deprecation, SHA-1 remains widely used in 2017 for document and TLS certificate signatures, and also in many software such as the GIT versioning system for integrity and backup purposes. A key reason behind the reluctance of many industry players to replace SHA-1 with a safer alternative is the fact that finding an actual collision has seemed to be impractical for the past eleven years due to the high complexity and computational cost of the attack. In this paper, we demonstrate that SHA-1 collision attacks have finally become practical by providing the first known instance of a collision. Furthermore, the prefix of the colliding messages was carefully chosen so that they allow an attacker to forge two PDF documents with the same SHA-1 hash yet that display arbitrarily-chosen distinct visual contents. We were able to find this collision by combining many special cryptanalytic techniques in complex ways and improving upon previous work. In total the computational effort spent is equivalent to 2 63.1 SHA-1 compressions and took approximately 6 500 CPU years and 100 GPU years. As a result while the computational power spent on this collision is larger than other public cryptanalytic computations, it is still more than 100 000 times faster than a brute force search.},

abstract = {Computer hardware, especially RAM, can suffer from random errors that manifest as corruption of one or more bits. The causes of these errors range from manufacturing defects to environmental factors such as cosmic rays and overheating. While the probability of a single error is small, the total error amount in all RAM connected to the Internet is significant. Malicious attackers can exploit these random errors remotely. This paper presents an attack called bitsquatting that leverages random errors and DNS to direct Internet traffic to attacker-­‐controlled destinations. To prove the feasibility of bitsquatting, several frequently resolved domains were bitsquatted and all HTTP requests to the subsequent domains were logged. An analysis of six months of log data reveals that virtually every operating system and platform is affected. Fortunately, bitsquatting attacks are easy to mitigate.},

@article{Anagnostopoulos2013,
abstract = {It is without doubt that the Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most decisive elements of the Internet infrastructure; even a slight disruption to the normal operation of a DNS server could cause serious impairment to network services and thus hinder access to network resources. Hence, it is straightforward that DNS nameservers are constantly under the threat of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a new, stealthy from the attacker's viewpoint, flavor of DNSSEC-powered amplification attack that takes advantage of the vast number of DNS forwarders out there. Specifically, for augmenting the amplification factor, the attacker utilizes only those forwarders that support DNSSEC-related resource records and advertize a large DNS size packet. The main benefits of the presented attack scenario as compared to that of the typical amplification attack are: (a) The revocation of the need of the aggressor to control a botnet, and (b) the elimination of virtually all traces that may be used toward disclosing the attacker's actions, true identity and geographical location. The conducted experiments taking into consideration three countries, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal demonstrate that with a proper but simple planning and a reasonable amount of resources, a determined perpetrator is able to create a large torrent of bulky DNS packets towards its target. In the context of the present study this is translated to a maximum amplification factor of 44. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{VanRijswijk-Deij2014,
abstract = {Over the past five years we have witnessed the introduction of DNSSEC, a security extension to the DNS that relies on digital signatures. DNSSEC strengthens DNS by preventing attacks such as cache poisoning. However, a common argu-ment against the deployment of DNSSEC is its potential for abuse in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, in particular reflection and amplification attacks. DNS re-sponses for a DNSSEC-signed domain are typically larger than those for an unsigned domain, thus, it may seem that DNSSEC could actually worsen the problem of DNS-based DDoS attacks. The potential for abuse in DNSSEC-signed domains has, however, never been assessed on a large scale. In this paper we establish ground truth around this open question. We perform a detailed measurement on a large dataset of DNSSEC-signed domains, covering 70{\%} (2.5 mil-lion) of all signed domains in operation today, and compare the potential for amplification attacks to a representative sample of domains without DNSSEC. At first glance, the outcome of these measurements confirms that DNSSEC in-deed worsens the DDoS phenomenon. Closer examination, however, gives a more nuanced picture. DNSSEC really only makes the situation worse for one particular query type (ANY), for which responses may be over 50 times larger than the original query (and in rare cases up to 179×). We also discuss a number of mitigation strategies that can have im-mediate impact for operators and suggest future research directions with regards to these mitigation strategies.},

However, from the point of view of an individual network resource such as DNS server and switch, it is not easy to mitigate such attacks because a distributed attack could be performed with multiple DNS servers and/or switches. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel security framework using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to store the history of DNS queries as an evidence to distinguish normal DNS responses from attack packets.

@article{Schmitt2018,
abstract = {Every Internet communication typically involves a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup for the destination server that the client wants to communicate with. Operators of DNS recursive resolvers---the machines that receive a client's query for a domain name, resolve it to a corresponding IP address, and ultimately return the IP address to the client---can learn significant information about client activity. Past work, for example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web browsing activity to the types of devices that a user has in his or her home (and the extent to which they are being used). Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various third parties have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user's DNS queries from his or her Internet service provider. Yet, these systems merely transfer trust to a different third party. We argue that no single party should be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those queries. To this end, we present Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To do so, ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated these queries. We present an initial deployment of ODNS; our experiments show that ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both for individual queries and for web page loads, and is compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel remotely-mounted attack that can expose the network identity of an anonymous client, hidden service, and anonymizing proxies. To achieve this, we employ single-end controlled available bandwidth estimation tools and a colluding network entity that can modulate the traffic destined for the victim. To expose the circuit including the source, we inject a number of short or one large burst of traffic. Although timing attacks have been successful against anonymity networks, they require either a Global Adversary or the compromise of substantial number of anonymity nodes. Our technique does not require compromise of, or collaboration with, any such entity. To validate our attack, we performed a series of experiments using different network conditions and locations for the adversaries on both controlled and real-world Tor circuits. Our results demonstrate that our attack is successful in controlled environments. In real-world scenarios, even an under-provisioned adversary with only a few network vantage points can, under certain conditions, successfully identify the IP address of both Tor users and Hidden Servers. However, Tor's inherent circuit scheduling results in limited quality of service for its users. This at times leads to increased false negatives and it can degrade the performance of our circuit detection. We believe that as high speed anonymity networks become readily available, a well-provisioned adversary, with a partial or inferred network map , will be able to partially or fully expose anonymous users.},

@techreport{rfc1035,
abstract = {This RFC describes the details of the domain system and protocol, and assumes that the reader is familiar with the concepts discussed in a companion RFC, "Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities" [RFC-1034]. The domain system is a mixture of functions and data types which are an official protocol and functions and data types which are still experimental. Since the domain system is intentionally extensible, new data types and experimental behavior should always be expected in parts of the system beyond the official protocol. The official protocol parts include standard queries, responses and the Internet class RR data formats (e.g., host addresses). Since the previous RFC set, several definitions have changed, so some previous definitions are obsolete. Experimental or obsolete features are clearly marked in these RFCs, and such information should be used with caution. The reader is especially cautioned not to depend on the values which appear in examples to be current or complete, since their purpose is primarily pedagogical. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.},

@article{Grothoff2018,
abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) provides crucial name resolution functions for most Internet services. As a result, DNS traffic provides an important attack vector for mass surveillance, as demonstrated by the QUANTUMDNS and MORECOWBELL programs of the NSA. This article reviews how DNS works and describes security considerations for next generation name resolution systems. We then describe DNS variations and analyze their impact on security and privacy. We also consider Namecoin, the GNU Name System and RAINS, which are more radical re-designs of name systems in that they both radically change the wire protocol and also eliminate the existing global consensus on TLDs provided by ICANN. Finally, we assess how the different systems stack up with respect to the goal of improving security and privacy of name resolution for the future Internet.},
